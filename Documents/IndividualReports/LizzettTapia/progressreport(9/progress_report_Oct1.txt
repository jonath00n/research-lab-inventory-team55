Porgress Update for October 1, 2024
Currently working on getting a working server.
Last week, on Tuesday September 24, 2024, I spoke and asked Stavros about getting a working server, and he said 
to try one of two things:
    1) get a free instance from an online server, and make sure I dont get charged (that they dont ask for any credit card information)
    2) email Paul Gratz about getting access to a server through A&M  

I went ahead and did both. 
Paul Gratz said he didnt have access to any A&M server, and he directed me to Engineering IT.
Engineering IT then directed me to Texas A&M High Performance Research Computing. I spoke about all these
updates with Professor Stavros and our TA Shima. I am currently waiting to hear back from HPRC, but Professor Stavros
mentioned that it seems like I'll be able to get some sort of working cluster through them.
So in the meantime while I wait to hear back, I will work on creating more databases.
